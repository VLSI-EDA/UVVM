# Getting started using UVVM

UVVM is Free and Open source, under the very flexible [MIT licence](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/blob/master/LICENSE).   
UVVM basically has two levels of usage: Basic/Introductory and Advanced.    
With the Basic/Introductory level you are given a library and methodology that provide common functionality for all testbenches from simple to expert with things like logging, alert handling, checking signals, waiting for signals, checking timing properties, simple randomisation, etc. This is explained directly below this chapter.   
A number of BFMs (Bus Functional Models) compatible with the Utility Library are provided as free and open source code as a kick-start for testbenches using interfaces like AXI lite/stream, Avalon, I2C, SPI, UART, SBI, GPIO, etc.   
For more advanced testbenches with either multiple interfaces, or the need to reach interface related corner cases, the VVC system is really great. This is explained below the Utility Library.   
A number of VHDL verification components (VVCs) are provided for free with this system.   
NOTE: All Libraries, BFMs, VVCs, etc have their own dedicated Quick Reference (QR) showing you all you need to use the respective part.

## Github directory naming notation
- The directories starting with 'uvvm_' are the core libraries for UVVM Utility Library and UVVM VVC System
- All directories starting with 'bitvis_vip_' are verification IP/modules from Bitvis
- All other directories starting with 'bitvis_' are design IP/modules from Bitvis
- Directories starting with 'x' are external (third party) libraries that work seamlessly with UVVM

## For developers with no previous UVVM experience:
### Step 1
You should start by first understanding and trying out the Utility Library. The basics here could be covered in less than one hour. The UVVM Utility Library has a *very* low user threshold - according to all users so far.
* Read the [README-file for UVVM Utility Library](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/blob/master/README_UVVM_Utility_Library.md) to get a first introduction to why, what and how.
* Go through the powerpoint 'Making a simple, structured and efficient VHDL testbench â€“ Step-by-step' linked to from the README-file

### Step 2
To compile Utility Library related VHDL files you can do the following:
* To compile Utility Library only: 
   1. Using Modelsim/Questasim project files:    
      Double click on uvvm_util/sim/uvvm_util.mpf (may have to relate file extension to simulator)
   1. Running commands inside Modelsim/Questasim/RivieraPro/ActiveHDL:   
      Run do-file: uvvm_util/script/compile_src.doc
      (Note that the path to the sim-directory uvvm_util/sim directory must be passed as an argument unless you are running the script from there)
   1. Using GHDL:    
      Use GHDL provided script with uvvm_util/script/compile_order.txt as input
   1. Any other approach - or with script problems:    
      Follow compile order given in uvvm_util/script/compile_order.txt    
      Note that VHDL 2008 must be used. Lines starting with '# ' are required library definitions    
        vlib <source_path>/sim/<lib_name>    
        vmap <lib_name> <source_path>/sim/<lib_name>    
* To compile the complete IRQC demo testbench including Utility Library and the IRQC DUT: 
  - For all i to iv above exchange path   'uvvm_util' with  'bitvis_irqc'
* To compile all above pluss all provided BFMs, the scripts for compiling the complete UVVM should be used. (See below)  (This compiles far more than you need, but than at least everything is pre-compiled)

If you want to run a demo testbench using the Utility library, including the SBI BFM, you can run bitvis_irqc/tb/irqc_tb.vhd

## For developers who understand the basics of UVVM Utility library and need more than just basic testbenches:
### Step 1
* A very brief introduction to making a structured testbench architecture can be found under https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/tree/master/_supplementary_doc Advanced Verification - Made simple.
* Our presentation at the ESA (European Space Agency) conference on SEFUW 2018 gives a good introduction to UVVM, Testbench architecture, VVCs and how UVVM is standardising the VHDL testbench architecture: https://indico.esa.int/indico/event/232/session/6/contribution/8/material/slides/0.pdf
* For a slightly deeper introduction - also explaining the challenges - please check out our PPT-file https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/blob/master/uvvm_vvc_framework/doc/The_critically_missing_VHDL_TB_feature.ppsx

### Step 2
The easiest way to compile the complete UVVM with everything (Utility Library, VVC Framework, BFMS, VVCs, etc) is to go to uvvm_vvc_framework/script and run 'compile_all.do' inside Modelsim/Questasim/RivieraPro/ActiveHDL.

Similarly for the UART VVC Demo using 'compile_demo_tb.do'

For GHDL use the provided 'compile_order.txt' files.

### Step 3
If you like to use UVVM in a more advanced way you should read the relevant documentation under  https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/tree/master/uvvm_vvc_framework/doc
